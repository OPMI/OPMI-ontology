OPMI: Ontology of Precision Medicine and Investigations

OPMI is an application ontology to support precision medicine and related investigations. It is community-driven and developed by following the OBO Foundry ontology development principles. OPMI reuses, aligns, and integrates related terms from existing ontologies in the OBO ontology liborary.

OPMI was first developed by extracting general precision medicine related terms from the Ontology of Respiratory Disease Investigation ([ORDI](https://github.com/OPMI/ordi)). Primarily developed by Drs. Hong Yu, Jie Zheng, and Oliver He, ORDI is an application ontology aimed to represent ontology terms related to respiratory diseases and related investigations. Dr. Hong Yu is a respiratory disease clinician and professor. ORDI was developed to meet different application scenarios from Dr. Yu's study.

OPMI is now supported by the NIH-supported Kidney Precision Medicine Project ([KPMP](http://kpmp.org)). In KPMP, OPMI aims to represent and standardize the metadata used in different clinical, pathological, and molecular KPMP investigation projects, including clinical electronical health record types, pathological study data types, and Omics data types.

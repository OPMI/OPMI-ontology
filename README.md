OPMI: Ontology of Precision Medicine and Investigation

OPMI is an application ontology to support precision medicine and related investigations. It is community-driven and developed by following the OBO Foundry ontology development principles. OPMI reuses, aligns, and integrates related terms from existing ontologies in the OBO ontology liborary.

OPMI was first developed by extracting general precision medicine related terms from the Ontology of Respiratory Disease Investigation ([ORDI](https://github.com/OPMI/ordi)). Primarily developed by Drs. Hong Yu, Jie Zheng, and Oliver He, ORDI is an application ontology aimed to represent ontology terms related to respiratory diseases and related investigations. Dr. Hong Yu is a respiratory disease clinician and professor. ORDI was developed to meet different application scenarios from Dr. Yu's study. The ORDI work was presented in the Biocuration-2018 conference held at Shanghai, China, April 8-11, 2018.

OPMI is now supported by the NIH-supported Kidney Precision Medicine Project ([KPMP](http://kpmp.org)). With >20 universities/institutes, KPMP aims to study a large number of human subjects with the acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). As required by the KPMP consortium research, OPMI aims to represent and standardize the entities associated with this project, including all the data/metadata types, investigation processes, and analysis in the various aspects of clinical, pathological, and molecular studies. Example KPMP data types include clinical electronical health record types, pathological image data types, and various Omics data types.
